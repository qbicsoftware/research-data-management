# Confounding Variables

A confounding variable is a factor that influences independent variable and dependant variable. 
A confounding variable can mix with the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable thus leading to erronous conclusions about the experiment.

At any time during your experiment, the data manager allows you to capture confounding variables. 

### Define confounding variables in your experiment

In order to work with confounding variables, first you must define them in your experiment. 
Confounding variables are experiment specific. Confounding variables do not interact with
information outside your experiment.

To define a new confounding variable, navigate to your experiment, open the _Confounding Variables_ tab, click on **Add confounding variables**. In case confounding variables are defined already, click **Add** in the top right corner of the tab.

After clicking the button, a dialog opens where you can **enter the names of your confounding variables**. Confirm your changes and the confounding variables are now defined in your experiment.

### Assign levels of a confounding variable to your sample

A confounding variable is only of use if levels are annotated on individual samples. 
In contrast to experimental variables, not all samples need to have a level in one confounding variable.

After [defining the confounding variables in your experiment](#define-confounding-variables-in-your-experiment), 
the confounding variables are added as columns in the sample registration and sample editing process.
You can now edit your sample metadata and add missing levels of a confounding variable for your sample.

### Rename a confounding variable

To remove a confounding variable, navigate to your experiment, open the _Confounding Variables_
tab and click on **Edit** in the top right corner. Each row corresponds to one confounding variable.
When you change the name of a confounding variable, the variable levels are kept and only the variable name changes.

### Delete a confounding variable

To remove a confounding variable, navigate to your experiment, open the _Confounding Variables_ 
tab and click on **Edit** in the top right corner. Each row corresponds to one confounding variable.
By removing a row and clicking on **Confirm**, you can delete the confounding variable. 

!!!warning
    Removing a confounding variable, will delete all annotated levels of that variable on all samples in your experiment.
